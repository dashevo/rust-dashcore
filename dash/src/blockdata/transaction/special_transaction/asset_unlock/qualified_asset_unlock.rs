//! Dash Credit Withdrawal Special Transaction.
//!
//! The credit withdrawal special transaction is used to withdraw from the asset lock credit pool.
//!
//!
//! It is defined in DIPX [dip-000X.md](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-000X.md) as follows:
//!
//!
//! The special transaction type used for CrWithTx Transactions is 9.
